### Abstract

The paper presents a comprehensive review of the maximum set packing problem and evaluates the performance and correctness of brute force and heuristic algorithms for solving it. Set packing, a combinatorial optimization problem, involves selecting a maximum subset of non-overlapping sets from a given collection. This study investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of two main approaches: brute force, which exhaustively explores all possible combinations, and heuristic algorithms, which employ intelligent strategies to quickly find near-optimal solutions. Extensive experimentation and general algorithm analysis are conducted to assess the performance and correctness of these algorithms. Maximum Set Packing problem is a NP-Hard problem.
